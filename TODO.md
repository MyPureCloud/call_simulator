Notes List
----------
- Doesn't seem to work when not on the same network.  i.e. if I am at home on the VPN and i try to contact my edge, the messages aren't being routed properly.


TODO Feature List
-----------------
- Pull stations from PureCloud that match a specific regex and register as those stations
- Use PureCloud Lookups to select the destination of the call from the server
- find a way to deploy to virtual edge, maybe with https://github.com/jaredallard/nexe
- figure out why it doesn't work across network barriers
